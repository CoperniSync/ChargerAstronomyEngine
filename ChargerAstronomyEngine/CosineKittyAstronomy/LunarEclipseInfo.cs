    /// <remarks>
    /// Returned by #Astronomy.SearchLunarEclipse or #Astronomy.NextLunarEclipse
    /// to report information about a lunar eclipse event.
    /// When a lunar eclipse is found, it is classified as penumbral, partial, or total.
    /// Penumbral eclipses are difficult to observe, because the Moon is only slightly dimmed
    /// by the Earth's penumbra; no part of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
    /// Partial eclipses occur when part, but not all, of the Moon touches the Earth's umbra.
    /// Total eclipses occur when the entire Moon passes into the Earth's umbra.
    ///
    /// The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Penumbral`, `EclipseKind.Partial`,
    /// or `EclipseKind.Total`, depending on the kind of lunar eclipse found.
    ///
    /// The `obscuration` field holds a value in the range [0, 1] that indicates what fraction
    /// of the Moon's apparent disc area is covered by the Earth's umbra at the eclipse's peak.
    /// This indicates how dark the peak eclipse appears. For penumbral eclipses, the obscuration
    /// is 0, because the Moon does not pass through the Earth's umbra. For partial eclipses,
    /// the obscuration is somewhere between 0 and 1. For total lunar eclipses, the obscuration is 1.
    ///
    /// Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
    ///
    /// Fields `sd_penum`, `sd_partial`, and `sd_total` hold the semi-duration of each phase
    /// of the eclipse, which is half of the amount of time the eclipse spends in each
    /// phase (expressed in minutes), or 0 if the eclipse never reaches that phase.
    /// By converting from minutes to days, and subtracting/adding with `peak`, the caller
    /// may determine the date and time of the beginning/end of each eclipse phase.
