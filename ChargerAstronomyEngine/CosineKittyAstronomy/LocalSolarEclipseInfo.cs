    /// <remarks>
    /// Returned by #Astronomy.SearchLocalSolarEclipse or #Astronomy.NextLocalSolarEclipse
    /// to report information about a solar eclipse as seen at a given geographic location.
    ///
    /// When a solar eclipse is found, it is classified as partial, annular, or total.
    /// The `kind` field thus holds `EclipseKind.Partial`, `EclipseKind.Annular`, or `EclipseKind.Total`.
    /// A partial solar eclipse is when the Moon does not line up directly enough with the Sun
    /// to completely block the Sun's light from reaching the observer.
    /// An annular eclipse occurs when the Moon's disc is completely visible against the Sun
    /// but the Moon is too far away to completely block the Sun's light; this leaves the
    /// Sun with a ring-like appearance.
    /// A total eclipse occurs when the Moon is close enough to the Earth and aligned with the
    /// Sun just right to completely block all sunlight from reaching the observer.
    ///
    /// The `obscuration` field reports what fraction of the Sun's disc appears blocked
    /// by the Moon when viewed by the observer at the peak eclipse time.
    /// This is a value that ranges from 0 (no blockage) to 1 (total eclipse).
    /// The obscuration value will be between 0 and 1 for partial eclipses and annular eclipses.
    /// The value will be exactly 1 for total eclipses. Obscuration gives an indication
    /// of how dark the eclipse appears.
    ///
    /// There are 5 "event" fields, each of which contains a time and a solar altitude.
    /// Field `peak` holds the date and time of the center of the eclipse, when it is at its peak.
    /// The fields `partial_begin` and `partial_end` are always set, and indicate when
    /// the eclipse begins/ends. If the eclipse reaches totality or becomes annular,
    /// `total_begin` and `total_end` indicate when the total/annular phase begins/ends.
    /// When an event field is valid, the caller must also check its `altitude` field to
    /// see whether the Sun is above the horizon at the time indicated by the `time` field.
    /// See #EclipseEvent for more information.
