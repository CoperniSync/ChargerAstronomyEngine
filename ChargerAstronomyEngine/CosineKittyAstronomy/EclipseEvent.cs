    /// because each event may be invisible to the observer if the Sun is below
    /// the horizon.

    /// visible if the Earth were transparent, but the observer cannot actually see it.
    /// If `altitude` is positive but less than a few degrees, visibility will be impaired by
    /// atmospheric interference (sunrise or sunset conditions).
