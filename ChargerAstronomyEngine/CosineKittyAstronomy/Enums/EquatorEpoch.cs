    /// The Earth's equator is not always in the same plane due to precession and nutation.
    ///
    /// Sometimes it is useful to have a fixed plane of reference for equatorial coordinates
    /// across different calendar dates.  In these cases, a fixed *epoch*, or reference time,
    /// is helpful. Astronomy Engine provides the J2000 epoch for such cases.  This refers
    /// to the plane of the Earth's orbit as it was on noon UTC on 1 January 2000.
    ///
    /// For some other purposes, it is more helpful to represent coordinates using the Earth's
    /// equator exactly as it is on that date. For example, when calculating rise/set times
    /// or horizontal coordinates, it is most accurate to use the orientation of the Earth's
    /// equator at that same date and time. For these uses, Astronomy Engine allows *of-date*
    /// calculations.
